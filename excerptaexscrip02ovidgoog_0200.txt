era. His parents wereof equestrianra ,and educated their son for
the bar; buthe soon sorsook this and every other pursuit sor the
cultivation of poetry, and at length became one os the most adrnired
and eminent pects in the court of Augustus. His prosperity was,
however, of short continuance. Having incurred‚ by some unknown
offense, the displeasure ol' tlre emperor, be was banished to Tomos, a

' town near the 'uxine sea; where, atter many ineffectual attempta to

obtain the pardon os Augustus, he ended his days, in the eiohth year
of his banishment, and the fifty-ninth year of his age. 'Plio poetry
os Ovid has long been celebrated forits variety, sweetness, and
eleganoe. But the frequent violatione of modesty‚ which disgraoe
some parts of his writings, detract much t'rom tho merit of this gifted
poet. His Metamorphoses, though not tlretmost finished of his oems,
