BOOK ΙΙΙ.

Ctouus was the son of Agenor, kin of Phoenicia. Jupiter, having
transformed himself into a bull, prevuiied on Europa, the sister of thia
priuce, to get on his back, and immediately plunging into the sea, hr
carried her across it into Crete. Agenor, ignorant of the fate of hia
daughter, aud disconsolate at her loss, ordered Cadmus to go in search
of 'bssuropa3 with a command not to return to Phoenicia till he tut
found her. The pursuit of Cadmus was fruitless. Hc could ircar ne
tidings of his sister, and not during to return to his native larr'd with
out her, he resolved to consult tbe oracle of Apollo at Delphi, that ho
mioht know in what part of tbe earth to fix his abode.

'i'he oracle directed him to follow a heifer, which was described to
him, and wherever she should lie down, there to buiid n city, and to
-· call the country Boeotia. Cadmus soon found the helfer,and put
himself under her guidunce; she at length lay down near the bank·
of tho river Cephisus, where he prepared to commence the city
according to the directions of the oracle. Here the present account
begins. The spot is a little north of Attica. Cadmus is supposed to
hove come into Greece A. C. 1493,ωά to have bron ht with him
the use of letters, and the worship of many of the {gyptiaa and
Pnoenician divinrties. Ἰ
