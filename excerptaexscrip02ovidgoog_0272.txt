Casan. Julius Caesar was one of the most celebrated of the Rod
man emperors3 and from him the name ofCaesar was transnritted to the
subsequent emperors. Endowed with extraordinary talenta, and influ-

of his country, and assumed at length the imperial power. His reign ‚

was, however, of short continuance. A conspiracy was formed egomet
him, with Brutus and Cassius at its head, and he was assassinated in
the senate-house, on the Ides of March, forty·four years before the

Christian era. Soon alter his death,anew star, or rather comet, was ·
